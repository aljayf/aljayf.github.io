summary: A program which allows the user to read and write records to a database. Written in both C and C++.
---

This program allows the user to create, remove, and print records on the database. Records contain name, address, and an account number. The records are stored in a database in numerical order by its account number. No records can have the same account number. When adding a record with an already existing account number the account number will be incremented to the next available account number. When exiting the program, the records added/deleted will be updated in the database.
