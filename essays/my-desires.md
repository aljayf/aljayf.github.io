My first interest in software engineering first came when a friend made me believe that an edit he made on a website was real. When he showed me, I immediately made him teach me how he did it. He showed me how you could change text on a website by highlighting the text and inspecting the element. From there I started to play around with inspect and see what else I could do. From there, I leard how to change texts and photos. This was very amusing for me. My Interest in software engineering grew further more when I was thought about all the possibities and what could be created from software engineering.
