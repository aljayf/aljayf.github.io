If you are coding, it is to your best interest to implement coding standards. Following coding standards allows code to maintain uniformity. In result, your code becomes more readible as it presents a common look and feel thus allowing it to to scale beyond one person. One may think of coding standards as a trivia way to know how many spaces to indent or to place a clise-curly-brace on a new line by itself, but I believe coding standards can improve quality and can actually help you learn a programming language. In the proccess of learning a new programming language, you make mistakes. Without coding standars and tools to enforce them, you may not be aware of these mistake until compilatation
