<h2>Stupid Questions?</h2>
Has your teacher ever told you that there is no such thing as a stupid question? Well, if they did, they lied. In the software engineering community, asking such questions may result in what seems to be arrogant answers. Software engineers dislike these types of questions because it seems as if the person asking the question is only looking for a solution rather than enlightenment.

Actually, there is no such thing as a stupid question. Howerver there does exist a "smart" way and a "stupid" way of asking questions. Asking questions the "stupid" way may have others think of another as a loser. In most cases, the solution to these questions are easily accessible from a simple search of the web or by reading the manual. In result, this portrays oneself as lazy and unwilling to think. However, you could ask the same question the "smart" way and avoid not look like a loser. The reason why asking questions the smart makes such a difference is because it shows that you have made the effort and actually tried to solve your own problem first. The reason this is very important to Software Engineers is because you will be able to give more information about what you've learned or what you didn't understand, the enviornment of your program, bugs, and overall a reduced problem. When your question is asked the "smart" way, it won't seem as a waste of time and will most likely be answered.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>"Not Smart"</h3>
If you would look at this ["Not Smart" Example link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52209137/validate-a-phone-number-in-laravel), we could easily that this is a "Not Smart" question. From this question, we could tell that the user has not made the effort to solve their own problem, but rather seek to obtain answer from someone else. The user hasn't mentioned what they tried, but instead asks how to perform the task. The lack of smartness in the question also reflect in the responses. In the first respnse, a link to a manual on how to use regex was provided. The smartness of the question could also reflect on the amount of upvotes or downvotes. If your question has at least one downvote, it probably was not a smart question.

<h3>"Smart Way"</h3>
Here is a link to a ["Smart" Example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52037320/yarn-procedure-for-redeploying-javascript-dependencies-to-production-server-us).
