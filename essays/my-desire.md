My desire to study software engineer and my desire to pursue a degree in computer science began with my desire to create something. Early in my life, I always wanted to own a clothing store of some sort. As I grew older, I saw how the internet and software plays a huge role in communicating your product globally. Being able to sell your product outside of a physical store great way of making revenue at a much faster rate. As I got more into clothing, I saw other things that software engineering played a role in. From there, my interest in software engineering kept growing as it made me want to create programs, websites and mobile applications.

As I started to make a little bit of money off selling clothes, I saw how other people used programs to get an advantage over me. These programs that these people used allowed them to purchase items off websites faster than humanly possible. In the future I'd want to experience developing a program that interacts with networks. 

In the future, I hope to develop my own website where I could sell my own product. I hope to become very skillful in web design and can different frameworks such as Flash. I first want to experience creating a basic website and work up from there. I desire to learn all the possibilities one could do in web design and to be able to make my visions real.

Lastly, I hope to gain skill and experience in creating mobile applications. What inspired me to learn how to create mobile applications was my use of apps to buy and sell clothes. I saw that a lot of people in the clothing community like to use mobile applications to buy and sell their clothes. Companies such as Depop and Grailed have a wide range of users all over the world who access their mobile application rather than their website. To be able to create such a mobile application is something that I desire to develop in the future.
